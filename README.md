# Docker - PERN App

I completed Smári´s tutorial on [The PERN stack with Docker for beginners](https://faun.pub/the-pern-stack-with-docker-for-beginners-9fa76e574d82). For practice, I added one more column to the table and modified the app to display all of the data from the table. I added basic CSS styling only to make project readable.

## To run the app follow these steps

1. clone these two repositories:
   <br>
   Client: <code>https://github.com/Attila-101/docker-pern-app.git</code>
   <br>
   Server: <code>https://github.com/Attila-101/docker-pern-app-server.git</code>
2. in the client files run the app from your terminal using first the <code>cd dockerpern-tutorial</code> command to move to the right folder then execute the <code>yarn run start</code> command
3. in the server files run the server from your terminal using the <code>node server.js</code> command
4. view the app in your browser at <code>http://localhost:3001</code>

Make sure that you have yarn installed and both the client and the server are running at the same time.
